- What is Handyhelp?

We may not realize it, but the world as it is today is not easily accessible to everyone, especially for people with disabilities. Handyhelp's goal is to help these people, not by modifying the infrastructures, but by helping them plan their trips and providing them with places that are easily accessible.
Handyhelp is aimed at people with reduced mobility.
For the moment, we limit ourselves to cultural places.

We had the opportunity to speak directly with a person with reduced mobility, which allowed us to better understand their needs and to better adapt our services to them.

In the future, a study could be carried out via social networks to gather even more information.


- Who are we?

We are a group of students from the University of Paris Nanterre: Ouweis, Ethan and Fadi.



- Why focus on cultural places at first?


As said before, it can be complicated for people with reduced mobility to satisfy their primary needs, but we should not forget the secondary needs.
There are already applications to help PRM in their daily tasks, but for secondary tasks it is more rare.
Everyone has the right to enjoy themselves, whether it's at a museum, a movie theater or any other place, and Handyhelp makes it a point of honor that people with reduced mobility can also enjoy themselves without wondering if, once there, it will be possible for them to fully enjoy their activity.
